# Bonfire Next

Based on the CodeIgniter 3 PHP framework and [SprintPHP][1], Bonfire provides a ready-to-roll admin area and tons of power tools to supercharge your custom web application development.

**NOTE: Bonfire Next is in a very early development version! This is NOT ready for usage in any form.**

## System Requirements

- PHP version 5.4 or newer.
- SimpleXML enabled on your PHP installation for the docs to work.
- Composer installed on development server.
- A Database. We currently use MySQL but try to keep it fairly flexible.

## How To Install?

Installation instructions can be found in the docs source here on [GitHub][2].

## What's In The Box?

In addition to the features found in Sprint, Bonfire adds the following useful tools:

* **GUI backend** area already setup for you.
* **Database Tools** - A GUI to manage do basic management of your database without logging into phpMyAdmin.
* **User Management** - including banning, creating, deleting, role management, etc. 
* **Security Logging** - on by default, will track user actions across sensitive areas, and gives you a simple way to add it to your application.
* **Settings Area** - automatically pulls in and integrates settings from all of the modules within the system to conveniently edit at one place.
* **Modular Dashboard** - makes it easy to add blocks for display on the dashboard from any module.


## Where's the Docs?
Docs are included in the repo itself, and it comes with a pretty nice documentation system built on simple Markdown-formatted files. 

To view the documentation, download the code, and point your browser to `/docs`. The rest should be working fine, but please [let me know][3] if you hit any snags! 

To view the docs prior to downloading, you'll have to [browse the files][4] in the repo for now. Before too long, we'll have a site setup for it. But the current focus is on the initial release getting whipped into shape.
